# Black9gag - A chrome extension to use night mode on 9gag.com

I was bored at my university and thought a night mode for 9gag would be awesome for me. Created this simple chrome extension to do that. Hope you will like it!

3. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
5. Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.
6. Visit [9gag](http://9gag.com) and enjoy!
